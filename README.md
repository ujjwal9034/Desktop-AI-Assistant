# Desktop AI Assistant - JARVIS v1.0

Hi there! 👋

Welcome to the first version of my personal Desktop AI Assistant – JARVIS v1.0 🧠💻

This project was built as a fun and useful desktop application to assist with basic tasks using voice commands. Think of it like your own mini JARVIS from Iron Man – helping you with simple stuff on your computer!

## 💡 Features
- Text-to-Speech (AI talks to you)
- Speech Recognition (You talk to AI)
- Perform tasks like:
  - Opening applications
  - Searching the web
  - Telling the date/time
  - Telling jokes and more!

## 📁 What's Inside?
- Python scripts for the assistant
- Required libraries mentioned in requirements.txt
- Sample commands
- A simple interface (if GUI is included)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the main script:
  python jarvis.py

4. Start talking! (Say commands like "open YouTube", "what’s the time", etc.)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- pyttsx3 (for TTS)
- speech_recognition
- datetime
- webbrowser
- os module

## 🎯 Purpose
This was a learning project to explore how AI voice assistants work. It helped me understand how voice recognition, automation, and Python libraries come together to build something interactive and cool.

## 📌 Note
This is just version 1.0 – there’s a lot of room for improvement! Feel free to fork it, improve it, or give suggestions.
